Yes, I have understood the requirements. You need ready-to-use CloudWatch Logs Insights queries to create dashboard widgets for:

1.  Total monthly API requests.
2.  A monthly breakdown of requests for each unique API URI.
3.  A query to filter for a specific URI path.

Here are the queries without any comments.

-----

### **1. Total API Requests Per Month**

```sql
parse @message '"RequestUri: * "' as RequestUri
| stats count(*) as totalRequests by bin(30d)
| sort @timestamp desc
```

-----

### **2. Monthly Requests Broken Down by API Path**

```sql
parse @message '"RequestUri: * "' as RequestUri
| stats count(*) as requestCount by bin(30d), RequestUri
| sort @timestamp desc
```

-----

### **3. Search/Filter for a Specific API Path**

*(This example filters for `/data-availability-check` and is displayed hourly for more detail)*

```sql
parse @message '"RequestUri: * "' as RequestUri
| filter RequestUri = '/data-availability-check'
| stats count(*) as requestCount by bin(1h)
| sort @timestamp desc
```
